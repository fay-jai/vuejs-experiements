             * Learnings from experiment:
             *
             * 1) Custom event names can not be camelCased. In my example,
             * if I named my custom event "aEvent" and bound my components
             * to listen for "aEvent", there would be no response. If
             * custom events are multiple words, use a hyphen to separate each
             * word.
             *
             * 2) When a child component emits a custom event, the part of the
             * parent component template that listens for the custom event must
             * be the child component. For example, when "my-child" emits the
             * "a-event", you must bind the "a-event" listener on the
             * "my-child" component within the "my-parent" component template.
             *
             * 3) When a child component emits a custom event, only the immediate
             * parent component can listen for the event. In other words, the
             * custom event does NOT automatically propagate up. In my example,
             * in order for "my-grand-parent" to hear the "a-event", the
             * "my-parent" component had to emit the "a-event" as well.
             *
             * 4) A child component can emit multiple custom events and a
             * parent component can listen to multiple custom events. Each
             * custom event requires a different listener on the parent
             * component.
             *
             * 5) There seems to be a sequential order in which custom events
             * are propagated from child to parent. In my example, the
             * "my-child" component is configured to emit "a-event" first and
             * then emit "b-event". Because "a-event" is emitted
             * first, it's entire chain of event propagation happens first before
             * the entire chain of event propagation for "b-event".
             * Concretely, this means that "my-child" emits "a-event" first,
             * then "my-parent" emits "a-event", then "my-grand-parent" emits
             * "d-event" BEFORE "b-event" is emitted from the
             * "my-child" component. If instead we reversed the order in which
             * "my-child" emits "a-event" and "b-event", the
             * order of event propagation is reversed! In fact, events are
             * emitted in a depth first approach: child emits 1st event, parent
             * emits first event, grand-parent responds to first event, then
             * parent emits second event, grand-parent responds to second event,
             * and then once parent has exhausted emitting all its events,
             * the child will emit its second event as well as the rest of its
             * event propagation.
             *
