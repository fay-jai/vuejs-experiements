                Use v-for directive to repeat / render a list of items.
                The reason we also need to bind the "plan" property is because
                this is the only way to ensure that the "plan" object is passed
                down to the component (or else it'd just be a "plan" string).

                Also note that if you have a multi-word prop name in the template,
                it must be hyphenated. But the corresponding prop name in JS will be
                camel-cased.

                Another interesting point is that the DOM element with the
                v-for attribute on it will be what's repeated and NOT just
                the content within that DOM element. In the example below,
                this means that the entire "div" itself is repeated multiple
                times within the "#app" element (and not just the "plan"
                component).

            <div v-for="plan in plans">
                <plan :plan-prop="plan"></plan>
            </div>
        </div>

        <template id="plan-template">
            <div>
                <span>{{ planProp.name }}: </span>
                <span>{{ planProp.price }} / month</span>
            </div>
        </template>

            var Plan = {
                template: "#plan-template",

                props: [ "planProp" ]
            };

            new Vue({
                el: "#app",

                data: {
                    plans: [
                        { name: "Enterprise", price: 100 },
                        { name: "Pro", price: 50 },
                        { name: "Personal", price: 10 },
                        { name: "Free", price: 0 }
                    ]
                },

                components: {
                    plan: Plan
                }
            });
