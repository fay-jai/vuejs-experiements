                In order to pass the 'someText' data property
                down to the 'counter' component, we have to do
                2 things:
                
                1) define the counter component to accept a
                "heading" prop
                
                2) bind the prop with the value associated with
                the "someText" property. If you don't bind it,
                then the 'counter' component will assume
                that you're passing the string value "someText"
                down to the "heading" prop.

                Example that doesn't work:

                <counter heading="someText"></counter>

                This would result in the counter component with
                a props value as the string 'someText' and not the
                interpreted value of 'Counter'.
            -->
            <counter v-bind:heading="someText"></counter>
            <counter :heading="someText"></counter>
        </div>
        
        <!--
            Instead of inlining a string template for the
            "template" property in a Component, define
            a template here with an id so that it can be
            referenced.
        -->
        <template id="counter-template">
            <div>
                <h1>{{ heading }}</h1>
                <button @click="increment">
                    Increment: {{ count }}
